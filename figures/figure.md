## Figure Descriptions

### 1. featureXoutcome.png
**Description**: Showing the linear relation between feature and outcome variables.

**Purpose**: Visualize the linear relationship.

**Key Insight**: Clear linear positive relationship present. 

### 2. RegressionFit.png
**Description**: This plot visualizes the regression line generated by the trained model overlaid on the actual test data points. 

**Purpose**: To evaluate how well the learned linear model generalizes to unseen data by inspecting the alignment of the predicted regression line with the actual observations.

**Key Insight**: The regression line closely follows the trend of the test data, indicating a strong fit and effective generalization of the model.
